/**
 * A state of the FSM.
 *
 * Corresponds to a state of the solver under test.
 *
 * We distinguish three configuration kinds (State::ConfigKind) of states:
 * - **regular** states
 * - **decision** states
 * - **choice** states
 *
 * We further identify one state as the *initial* state, and one state as
 * the *final* state.
 *
 * A **decision state** is a state that only serves as decision point with a
 * single point of entrance and only specific transitions (the choices to be
 * made) out of the state. A decision state is not to be extended with any
 * other actions other than the transitions that represent the choices this
 * decision state has been created for. From a decision state, we may only
 * transition into the choice states that represent the valid choices for
 * this decision.
 *
 * A **choice state** is a state that represents a valid choice for a specific
 * decision. It represents a very specific solver state that is a precondition
 * for specific actions (solver API calls) to be executed.
 * Choice states may only be transitioned into from their corresponding
 * decision state.
 *
 * As an example, we use a decision state #DECIDE_SAT_UNSAT for handling
 * different solver states after a satisfiability check in state #CHECK_SAT.
 * From #CHECK_SAT, we transition into #DECIDE_SAT_UNSAT, from where we
 * transition into either choice state #SAT (when the result is *sat* or
 * *unknown*) or #UNSAT (when the result is *unsat*).
 * Each choice state configure actions to make additional queries to the
 * solver under the specific premise that a check-sat call has been issued and
 * the satisfiability result is either sat or unsat.

/**
 * The finite-state machine (FSM).
 *
 * Valid API call sequences are generated based on an API model which is
 * implemented as a weighted finite-state machine (FSM).
 * States correspond to the current state of the SMT solver, and transitions
 * have a weight, a pre-condition, and an associated action.
 *
 * Each State of the FSM may provide a pre-condition that defines when it is
 * legal to transition into that state. Taking a transition also executes its
 * action. The associated action of a transition may be empty, in which case it
 * leads to the next state without calling the solver. The pre-condition of a
 * transition and the pre-condition of its next state define the conditions
 * under which the transition can be selected, whereas its weight determines
 * the probability of it being taken in cases where multiple transitions are
 * enabled at the same time.
 *
 * The weight of a transition is defined via its *priority* when adding
 * transitions to a state via :cpp:func:`murxla::State::add_action()`. A
 * priority of ``1`` indicates highest priority, ``UINT32_MAX`` lowest
 * priority, and ``0`` disables the transition.
 *
 * A transition with an associated action is defined by adding a
 * :cpp:class:`murxla::Action` to a state via
 * :cpp:func:`murxla::State::add_action()` while defining its priority and next
 * state. Similarly, empty transitions are added as instances of
 * :cpp:class:`murxla::Transition`.
 *
 * By default, the FSM implements an API model that captures the functionality
 * and constraints defined in the SMT-LIB standard. Its associated actions call
 * the Generic Solver API.
 * Solver wrappers may extend the model with solver-specific states and actions.
 *
 * We distinguish three configuration kinds (State::ConfigKind) of states:
 * **regular** states, **decision** states and **choice** states (see State
 * for more information).
 * We further identify one state as the *initial* state, and one state as
 * the *final* state.
 *
 * A **decision state** is a state that only serves as decision point with a
 * single point of entrance and only specific transitions (the choices to be
 * made) out of the state. A decision state is not to be extended with any
 * other actions other than the transitions that represent the choices this
 * decision state has been created for. From a decision state, we may only
 * transition into the choice states that represent the valid choices for
 * this decision.
 *
 * A **choice state** is a state that represents a valid choice for a specific
 * decision. It represents a very specific solver state that is a precondition
 * for specific actions (solver API calls) to be executed.
 * Choice states may only be transitioned into from their corresponding
 * decision state.
 *
 * As an example, we use a decision state State::DECIDE_SAT_UNSAT for handling
 * different solver states after a satisfiability check in state
 * State::CHECK_SAT. From State::CHECK_SAT, we transition into
 * State::DECIDE_SAT_UNSAT, from where we transition into either choice state
 * State::SAT (when the result is *sat* or *unknown*) or State::UNSAT (when the
 * result is *unsat*). Each choice state configure actions to make additional
 * queries to the solver under the specific premise that a check-sat call has
 * been issued and the satisfiability result is either sat or unsat.
 *
 * Use FSM::new_decision_state() for creating decision states,
 * FSM::new_choice_state() for creating choice states,
 * and FSM::new_final_state for creating the final state.
